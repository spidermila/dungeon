# Dungeon

This is a simple game made for learning and testing Python basics, including the cool [pre-commit CI](https://results.pre-commit.ci/) by [Asottile](https://github.com/asottile).

The idea for this text based game came from a discussion with my son who's learning programming in the age of 13. I let him do his implementation while I try stuff in mine.

Will this ever become a real game? ðŸ˜„
